<h1>IE Evaluation</h1>

<p>The IE evaluation for the GE task of BioNLP-ST 2013 is based on
the <b>equality of events</b> as defined below. That is, each
submitted event will be judged either as correct or incorrect as a
whole (as opposed to e.g. measuring each event argument assignment
separately).  Evaluation results are reported using the standard
precision/recall/f-score metrics.</p>

<p>The evaluation thus places an emphasis on getting entire events
right, as opposed to just those arguments that can be predicted most
confidently.</p>

<h2>Event equality</h2>

<p>There are several aspects to the equality of events, including
event type, the identification of the words expressing the event
(event trigger expression), the event participants and arguments, and,
in turn, the correctness of the entities and events that these refer
to.  We will apply a number of different correctness criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>strict equality</b>: for an event to be correct, it
must match an event of the gold standard annotation in all of the
above-mentioned aspects.</li>
<li><b>approximate boundary matching</b>: the spans of identified entities and
event trigger expressions are allowed to differ from the exact gold spans.</li>
<li><b>approximate recursive matching</b>: the requirement that for an
event to be correct, events that it refers to must also be correct is
relaxed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Detailed definitions are given below. Note that all criteria
require the type of the event to be correct and that all participants
and arguments are correct. Combinations of the criteria may also be
considered.</p>

<a name="strict"></a>
<h2>Strict equality</h2>


<p>The strict equality criteria require that for a submitted event to
match a gold standard event:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) The event types are the same</li>
<li>2) The event trigger expressions are the same</li>
<li>3) For each event argument, there is a matching argument where the referenced entities/events match:
<ul>
<li>3.1) Types are the same (both entities and events)</li>
<li>3.2) The text spans (entities) / trigger expressions (events) are the same</li>
<li>3.3) The arguments of events are the same (recursively following this definition)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>(In (3), "for each event argument" should be understood to refer to
both the answer and gold, and "matching argument" to gold or answer
(resp.): there can be no extra or missing arguments.)

<p>Two entity / trigger expression spans (beg<sub>1</sub>, end<sub>1</sub>) and (beg<sub>2</sub>, end<sub>2</sub>), are the same iff beg<sub>1</sub> = beg<sub>2</sub> and end<sub>1</sub> = end<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Although strict equality serves as the basis of the evalution
criteria, considering the complexity of the problem and some of the
features of the data, it may be viewed as impratically strict.  We
therefore provide also the relaxed evaluation criteria which are
defined considering the value of extracted information from a
practical point of view.</p>

<a name="approximate_span"></a>
<h2>Approximate span matching</h2>


<p>In detail, with differences to strict criteria <b>in bold</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) The event types are the same</li>
<li><b>2) The given event trigger expression is equivalent to that of the gold standard</b></li>
<li>3) For each event argument, there is a matching argument where the referenced entities/events match:
<ul>
<li>3.1) Types are the same (both entities and events)</li>
<li><b>3.2) The given text span (entities) / trigger expression (events) is equivalent to that of the gold standard</b></li>
<li>3.3) The arguments of events are the same (recursively following this definition)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For approximate matching, <b>equivalent</b> is defined as follows:
a given span is equivalent to a gold span if it is entirely contained
within an extension of the gold span by one word both to the left and
to the right, that is, beg<sub>1</sub> &gt;= ebeg<sub>2</sub> and
end<sub>1</sub> &lt;= eend<sub>2</sub>, where (beg<sub>1</sub>,
end<sub>1</sub>) is the given span and (ebeg<sub>2</sub>,
eend<sub>2</sub>) is the extended gold span.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, the given span (underlined)
<i>A <u>plays</u> role in [...]</i> is equivalent to the (hypothetical) gold span
<i>A plays <u>role</u> in [...]</i> as it is contained in the extended span
<i>A <u>plays role in</u> [...]</i>.</p>

<a name="approximate_span_without_trigger_matching"></a>
<h2>Approximate span matching without event trigger matching</h2>

<p>It is the same with Approximate span matching except it ignores event triggers.</p>


<a name="approximate_recursive"></a>
<h2>Approximate recursive matching</h2>


<p>In detail, with difference to strict criteria <b>in bold</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) The event types are the same</li>
<li>2) The event trigger expressions are the same</li>
<li>3) For each event argument, there must be a matching argument where the referenced entities/events match:
<ul>
<li>3.1) Types are the same (both entities and events)</li>
<li>3.2) The text spans (entities) / trigger expressions (events) are the same</li>
<li><b>3.3) The arguments of events match partially</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For <b>partial matching</b>, only Theme arguments are considered. Referred events are 
thus considered to match even if they differ in non-Theme arguments.</p>


<a name="decomposition"></a>
<h2>Event Decomposition Mode</h2>

<p>Many events are expressed with more than one argument, e.g.
<i>binding of multiple proteins</i> or <i>regulation with a theme and a cause</i>.
Such events are inherently more difficult to extract than events with a single argument.
In the Event decomposion mode, events with multiple arguments are decomposed into multiple single-argument events.</p>

<p>Specifically, in this mode, each multi-argument event
<pre>
t-entity-for-event-trigger, arg1-type:arg1-value, arg2-type:arg2-value, ...
</pre>
is decomposed into single-argument events
<pre>
t-entity-for-event-trigger, arg1-type:arg1-value
t-entity-for-event-trigger, arg2-type:arg2-value
...
</pre></p>
<p>The resulting single-argument events are treated as separate events in evaluation, thus allowing
recognition of partially correct events and awarding the recognition of complex events more highly.
Note that the Event decomposition mode is used in combination with other matching modes.</p>
